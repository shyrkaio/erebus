# Basic use case deployment with correct labels

In this scenario I have a ns `hypnos-test-uc010` in witch I have a deployment `hypnos-010` of 3 nginx.

The hynpos configuration should stop every 5 min and start it every 7 min. _It is not really perfect, yet it should be a good demonstration_

In this scenario, everything should be correctly configure. (no missing conf, no default conf)
